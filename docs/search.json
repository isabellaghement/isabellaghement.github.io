    "text": "Onions Have Layers - So Does R\nWe all know that onions are made of layers. But did you know that, when working with R, you can break down statistical computations or data visualizations into separate layers? Each layer builds upon the previous layer and all layers together add up to produce the desired result. Performing a statistical computation or creating a data visualization in R is therefore akin to assembling an onion from its innermost to its outermost layer, one layer at the time.\nTo make things easy, let’s imagine that statistical computations are similar to red onions and data visualizations are similar to white onions. Both have layers, but their layers are different in nature. Statistical computations (e.g., transforming variables, computing summary statistics, fitting models) have computational layers, whereas data visualizations (e.g., producing histograms, creating scatterplots) have visualizations layers.\nOnce we master the underlying mechanism for adding together a series of computational layers (corresponding to a red onion) or a series of visualization layers (corresponding to a white onion), we can get creative and combine these two types of layers to get an onion which is half-white and half-red. In other words, we can combine together computational and visualization layers.\nOne of the reasons we have to distinguish between computational and visualization layers in R is that they get added to previous layers of the same kind via different R operators:\nComputational layers get added via the pipe operator %&gt;%; Visualization layers get added via the plus operator +. Another reason we have to distinguish between computational and visualization layers in R is because they are implemented using different R functions from possibly different R packages."

In this case, the red onion consists of computing the mean value of the Temp (i.e., daily temperature in degrees F), which comes from the airquality dataset in R but after converting the units of this variable from degrees F to degrees C. (F stands for Fahrenheit and C stands for Celsius.)\nFirst, we load the airquality data into the current R session and we also load the packages dplyr and magrittr.\n\ndata(airquality)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nNext, we compute the mean of the re-expressed Temp variable using a series of three computational layers. The first layer (i.e., the innermost layer) is called airquality and simply declares the dataset we are working with. The second layer is called mutate and is used to re-express the Temp variable from degrees F to degrees C; the re-expressed variable is TempC. The third layer (i.e., the outermost layer) is called summarise and is used to compute the mean of TempC after excluding all missing values present in this variable.\n\nairquality %&gt;%\nmutate(TempC = (Temp - 32) * 5 / 9) %&gt;%\nsummarise(MeanTempC = mean(TempC, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n  MeanTempC\n1   25.4902\n\n\nUpon executing the above R code, R will inform us that the mean value of the TempC variable is 25.4902 degrees C."

The model utilized data from a descriptive, cross-sectional study, of 39,542 children aged 11 - 17 years, collected using the 2007 National Survey of Children’s Health.\nThe findings produced by the statistical analyses we conducted for this project suggested that obesity interventions concerning adolescents should target not only adolescents’ sedentary behavior and physical activity but also parents’ perceptions of safety, access to physical activity and the neighborhood condition.\nThe project resulted in the following scientific publication:\nA Model of Environmental Correlates of Adolescent Obesity in the United States\n\nAuthors: Kathryn C.

    "text": "Case Study: Efficacy of a Minimal Dose School Fruit and Vegetable Snack Intervention\nFruit and vegetable consumption is important to health but many Canadian children are not consuming enough fruits and vegetables. The provision of free fruit and vegetables at school over a school year can increase fruit and vegetable intake but the associated costs may hinder/prohibit adoption or sustained implementation of this approach.\nWe took on a statistical consulting project which helped evaluate the impact of a minimal dose free school fruit and vegetable snack intervention on children’s fruit and vegetable knowledge, self-efficacy and intake. The project required us to analyse data from a pre-post quasi-experimental study, in which 10 schools were assigned to the Intervention group and 10 schools were assigned to the Control group. The schools in the Intervention group were registered to begin receiving the British Columbia School Fruit and Vegetable Nutrition Program during the winter term (4 months of intervention, 14 servings, 2 times/week every second week). The schools in the Control group were usual practice schools and were matched by geographic area with the schools in the Intervention group. Fruit and vegetable intake, self-efficacy and knowledge were assessed for select children in both groups using a validated 24-hour recall and food frequency questionnaire, a validated fruit and vegetable efficacy instrument and program specific questions.\nFor this project, we used a mixed effect ANCOVA with a fixed effect for treatment group and a random effect for school nested within treatment group to analyse changes over time in children’s fruit and vegetable knowledge, intake and self-efficacy.\nThe findings of our statistical analyses for this project suggested that children in this study were below Canadian guideline levels for fruit and vegetable consumption and that the 14 servings of fruits and vegetables over 4 months were not enough to change fruit and vegetable knowledge, intake and self-efficacy. Based on these findings, a recommendation was made by the study investigators that the total dose of fruit and vegetables needs to be higher than 14 servings and that the frequency of delivery of these servings may also influence impact.\nThe project resulted in the following peer-reviewed research article:\nEfficacy of a Minimal Dose School Fruit and Vegetable Snack Intervention\n\nAuthors: Naylor PJ, McConnell J, Rhodes RE, Barr SI, Ghement I and Scott J.\nDetails: Journal of Food and Nutritional Disorders 2014, 3:4 doi: 10.4172/2324-9323.1000147.\nView: Abstract."
